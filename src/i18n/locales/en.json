    "question8": "Can I get a refund because I couldn't report the customs withdrawal when I left the country?",
    "answer8-1": "Confirmation of customs withdrawal is a prerequisite for refund processing. If you have not received customs clearance, you will not be able to receive a refund.",

    "answer16-1": "A statement for monthly refunds will be emailed by the 2nd of the following month. After checking, please complete settlement by the end of the month.",

    "answer17-1": "No. Only completed refunds for foreign tourists need to be settled.",
    "answer17-2": "Receipts that were issued but not refunded to the customer are not settled and must be reported as sales VAT.",
